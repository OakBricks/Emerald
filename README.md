# Oak's Minecraft Launcher
#### a shitty mutlimc clone made in java

# Why?
There are no good java launchers (In my opinion) so I tried to make my own (about five times already, including this)

# How?
To be honest, idk

# What is complete
- [x] GUI
- [ ] Launching
- [x] Accounts/Auth
- [x] Accounts/Mangement/GUI
- [ ] Instances

# Other neat features
- [ ] Scripting for events, such as launching an instance and closing an instance (maybe using jLua or Jython)
- [ ] Instance wrapper (so shit like PackWiz would work)
